# 01-Forest Speaker (drawing)

What it is:
Three green circles representing speakers on a dark background. The slight shake gives a sense of bass and
life without sound. 

How I made it:
I used createcanvas, background, fill, and three ellipse shapes. Inside draw() I added small random
movement. A typo once broke the code which taught me how precise coding needs to be.

Why this choice:
I called it "Forest Speaker" for its green tones,organic yet mechanical. It works as an abstract emoji for 
sound and hints at the themes of repetition and control I'll explore later.
