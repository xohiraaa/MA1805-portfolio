Five p5.js mini artworks: rave/ bass/ forest/ glitch theme.

# 1. Drawing- "Forest Speaker"
   Green wobbling circles like sub-woofer cones in the dark.

# 2. Movement- - "Orbit Raver" 
What it is: Eight neon dots glide in slow motion around an invisible centre, hues washing from green to pink. No bass this time, just the afterglow of a rave that's winding down.

How I made it: createCanvas, translate to centre, then a single for loop that clones the dot 8 times. Each frame adds a tiny angle (0.004) so the dots move a little bit, and the hues change to the next shade. Near the beginning, I made a small mistake: the trig parts sat outside draw() and appeared as "not defined", so I fixed that error.

Why this choice:
I wanted movement that feels tired but still moving, like dancers orbiting the floor at 3AM. The looped maths becomes choreography and the slow colour shift becomes the last lights fading in the ceiling.
